# Requirements

For local development without Docker:

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 20 or higher
* PostgreSQL 15 or higher

# Local Development Setup

# Backend

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend server will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

# Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will run at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

# Docker Setup

Docker is the recommended way to run the full stack.

# Development

```
docker-compose up -d
```

# Production

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

The production setup disables hot reload and is intended to be used behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS enabled.

# Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/agri_ai
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-secure-secret

GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-key

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-key

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/google/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Do not commit the `.env` file to version control.
Use a `.env.example` file for reference instead.

To generate a secure secret key:

```
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
```

# Database Notes

When using Docker, PostgreSQL is managed automatically by Docker Compose.

For local development without Docker, ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible using the credentials provided in the environment variables.

# Running Tests

Backend tests:

```
cd backend
pytest
```

Frontend tests:

```
cd frontend
npm test
```

# Deployment Notes

* Use the production Docker Compose file
* Set environment variables securely on the server
* Run the application behind Nginx or a cloud load balancer
* Ensure HTTPS is enabled
* Use strong secrets and production API keys
